# top-progress-in-a-page
Tracking My Progress of The Odin Project
My purpose in making this repo is to gain experience and see a representation of my progress.
As I delve deeper into TOP I hope to apply what I learn to continue to update previous works, with exceptions to parts that may be
less intuitive for the purposes of learning.
